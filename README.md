# Week 3 Challenge

## Description

This project is to showcase my understanding of javascript basics. This is done by creating a password generator. Application will ask user to input how long the password should and if they want lower case, upper case, numbers, and/or special characters in the password. Once all criteria is taken in, the application will generate a password based on user critera.

How the popups should come up for users to select their password critera:
